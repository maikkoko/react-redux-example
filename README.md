# React Redux Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with concepts and structure derived from [davezuko](https://github.com/davezuko)'s [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).

### Features
- [CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) application (not ejected)
- Code Splitting
- [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- [react-router-v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux)
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

The goal of this project is to provide a starter-kit/boilerplate for creating react applications that readily contains the above features without having to repeatedly setup via CRA.
